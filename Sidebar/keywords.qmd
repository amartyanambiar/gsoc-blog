### Amplicon 
- DNA or RNA molecule that is amplified or copied through a laboratory technique called polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or ligase chain reaction (LCR).
- Output of Amplification process.
- Amplification -> Larger number of copies of a specific DNA sequence.

### Biome 
- Biogeographical unit consisting of a biological community.
- *Ocean, Soil, etc.* 

### DNA
- **D**eoxyribo**N**ucleic **A**cid.
- Double-stranded molecule that contains the genetic code.

### ENA
- [European Nucleotide Archive](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/home)
- A global database of DNA and RNA sequences.
- Data from ENA is used in MGnify.

### Genome
- Complete genetic material of an organism.
- Made up of [DNA](#DNA).
- *Example : Human Genome consists of 3 billion nucleotides (23 pairs of chromosomes)*

### Metagenome
- Metagenome is the genetic material recovered directly from environmental or clinical samples by a method called sequencing. 
- Metagenomics is the study of the structure and function of these nucleotide sequences.

### Metagenome Assembled Genome (MAG)
- A metagenome assembled genome is a genome reconstructed from metagenomic data. 
- 1 partial or complete genome
- **1 MAG** = **1 species**

### MGnify
- The [MGnify platform](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/) facilitates the assembly, analysis and
archiving of microbiome-derived nucleicacid sequences.
- Hub for the analysis and exploration of metagenomic, metatranscriptomic, amplicon and assembly data.
- [EMBL's European Bioinformatics Institute](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/) ðŸ™Œ
